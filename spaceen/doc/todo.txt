Mobile is still choppy at image-echo-mode ...
Direct draw still has an extra speed resource:
	make twin buffer
	make #canvas-twin : { visibility : hidden; and
	change visibility right after direct-draw
	this will save an extra browser paste

	problem with resize still remains ... possibly blur edges at risize
